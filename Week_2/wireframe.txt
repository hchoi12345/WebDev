When you wireframe, you cannot jump to the conclusion and make something.
There are always going to be steps that you need to take before you wireframe.
You have to, first, know what the problem is that you want to solve.
After you know what the problem is, you need to sketch out what is that you are trying to solve.
Feedback is one of the most important things in the process because you are not creating the product for yourself.
The product is for the audience you are designing for. You cannot depend on yourself to know everything in the world.
You need another perspective so your product can become the best it can be.
Then, you need to use the tools to make what you have to make your product. That is why you wireframe.
Wireframing will help you better understand what goes where and how your audience will look at your product.
There needs to be a way you need to satisfy your audience, so you have to wireframe, which is basically sketching, but with a higher fidelity.
Feedback and getting stuff wrong is the best way to succeed and have the best product possible.

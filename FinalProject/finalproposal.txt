Plan:

Continuing the idea from my midterm
Changing “fancy” and “quick” restaurants to cuisine type
Might change it to price range
Bootstrap Nav – Drop Down Menu for price range/cuisine
Bootstrap Carousel/Slider – different pictures –> different angles in the restaurant and outside
Change the search bar into an input
Using Google Maps to show the location of restaurant
Use jquery on home page to greet the customer
